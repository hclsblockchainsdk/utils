Release Note

- Retrieve channel configuration information from solution's solutions.yaml only, rather than from channel_config field of solution's config.json.  This change requires adding a "create_channel" field under each channel specified in solutions.yaml and allows for removing the "channel_config" field from config.json (which is no longer referenced).
- Modify chain helper's buildErrorJson function to allow for parsing error messages that do not include a "message: " string.

chain_helper.js
- Allow "instantiate_chaincode", "install_chaincode", and "create_channel" fields in solutions.yaml to be optional.  Rather than throw an error if any one of these is not provided, set a default value of false.

- We need to update Fabric CA client's timeout value to 20000 because with multiple
threads (ie, 20 callers, 20 transactions at the same time), CA either gives Authentication
error during enroll or the CA just times out.
user_manager.js
- Enrollment was taken out because the only reason to enroll is to retrieve user keys that were saved in CA attributes,
so there is no need to enroll if it's a new user being registered since we are generating the keys within the same function.
This resolves the CA Authentication error during enroll.
request_handler.js
- Delete enrollment parameter
chain_helper.js
- Delete enrollment parameter

- Add de-identifier utils to interact with De-Identifier service.
- De-Identify User ID when retrieve login token.
  User ID is PHI/PII data and cannot be stored in chaincode.
  So User ID should be de-identified before it stored.
  And de-identified User ID should be used to get login token except app admin user.
